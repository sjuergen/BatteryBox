BatteryBox 

#Idea:
While I was camping with my T5 Multivan - used at the one hand as an usual car and at the other hand as a camper van, I had the problem, with the 12V power supply for my bus. Since I had just the starter battery, I had two times the situation, that the cooling box and other equipment has consumed too muchenergy from the starter battery so that I was forced to find a solution.
