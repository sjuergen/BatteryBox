BatteryBox

# Situation

While I was camping with my T5 Multivan - used at the one hand as an usual car and at the other hand as a camper van, I had the problem  with the 12V power supply for my bus. Since I had just the starter battery, I had two times the situation, that the cooling box and other equipment has consumed too much energy from the starter battery so that I couldn't start the motor. I was forced to find a solution. The main guideline was: it should be as cheap as possible.

# Idea

In my basement I had an old starter battery with 84Ah capacity, which is suitable for

Integrate it in a 400x300mm Eurobox to be part

And I want to use ist for a "quite" independent "Power-Supply". My expectations are:

- supply the cooling box (in my case an Dometic CF35W) with power for a couple of hours while I'm hiking without consumption power from the starter battery
- don't spent money for the fully integration of a second battery which can be charged via the alternator
- I don't have the expectation, that I

# Requirements

- can be switched off with an main switch
- can be charged by an car battery charger with 230V
- cooling box can be connected
- USB (smartphones) devices can be charged
- a battery pulser is integrated
- while the alternator is running all the devices should be powered by the car electric
- when the alternator is off, all devices should be powered by the second battery

# Future steps

- connect a solar panel to charge the battery box while you're autarkic
- connect a external charger (power booster) to charge the battery box during the alternator is running
